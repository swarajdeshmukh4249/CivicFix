"""Photo-derived severity: a deterministic formula over real pixel
statistics, computed fresh from each uploaded photo - not a trained model,
no learned weights, nothing fit to labeled data. In the same spirit as
app/core/priority.py's fixed formula and app/nlp/severity.py's keyword
bands: every number here comes from the actual image bytes at request time.

This intentionally supersedes ARCHITECTURE.md 5.4 / the original "no photo
severity model" rule, by explicit product decision: a photo-derived signal
is now shown as a first-class severity input, not a disclaimed experiment.

Three real, cheap image statistics combine into one score:
  - edge_density: mean intensity after edge detection - cracked/broken/
    cluttered surfaces produce far more edges than a plain road or wall.
  - dark_ratio: fraction of pixels below a brightness threshold - proxies
    pooled water, deep cavities, and shadow-heavy damage.
  - saturation_variance: spread of HSV saturation - a chaotic pile (garbage,
    debris) has wildly inconsistent color saturation; a clean surface doesn't.
