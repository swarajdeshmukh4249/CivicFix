# against our actual synthetic Pune complaint phrasing ("Sewage overflowing
# near Ward 11 again..."), it confidently (0.85-0.97) calls 6 of 7 sample
# complaints 'other'. That's a real domain-shift failure: NYC 311's terse
# bureaucratic descriptors don't resemble how our complaints are phrased,
# and the model learned NYC 311's vocabulary, not general civic-complaint
# semantics. Deploying it live would make classify() worse than the
# baseline it's meant to beat. evaluate_classifier() saves here by
# default, not to MODEL_PATH, so re-running it doesn't silently redeploy
# a known-regressive model - promote it manually only after it's been
# validated on Pune-style text.
