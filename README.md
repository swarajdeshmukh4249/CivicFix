# CivicFix 🏛️

Civic complaints shouldn't disappear into a queue. CivicFix is an intelligent civic issue triage and accountability platform designed for municipal corporations. It bridges the gap between citizens reporting local issues and the government agencies responsible for resolving them, while cross-referencing complaints with funded public works (like MPLADS) to enforce transparency.

## 🌟 Key Features

### For Citizens
* **Multilingual Intake:** Report civic issues in your native language via text or speech.
* **Smart Duplication Prevention:** The system automatically groups your complaint with similar ones nearby to form a single, high-priority tracked issue.
* **Transparent Tracking:** Browse an interactive spatial map of all issues across wards, check priority scores, and verify public records.
* **Feedback Loop:** Once an issue is marked resolved by the municipality, residents can confirm the fix or dispute it with fresh evidence.

### For Administrators
* **Spatial Evidence Map:** A comprehensive view of citizen issues, matched public works, and sensitive sites (hospitals, schools) on a single interactive canvas.
* **Auditable Priority Formulas:** Triage issues not based on guesswork, but on a deterministic, fully transparent formula considering severity, exposure, recurrence, and time open.
* **MPLADS Cross-Check:** Automatically matches civic complaints with existing government-funded public work records to surface potential fraud or overlapping responsibilities.
* **Verification Signals:** Highlights data discrepancies and priority signals through automated auditing algorithms.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

CivicFix is built using a modern, scalable stack:

**Frontend**
* **React 18** via Vite
* **Tailwind CSS v4** for responsive, utility-first styling
* **Lucide React** for beautiful, consistent iconography
* Custom **Glowing UI Components** for a modern, interactive design system

**Backend**
* **FastAPI (Python)** providing high-performance, asynchronous REST endpoints
* **Geospatial Processing** for ward mapping and coordinate clustering
* **Deterministic Matching Engine** for public works verification
